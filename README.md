# RPG-Dungeon-Crawler-Game
This text-based dungeon crawler game was a project I created for my C++ class in college. At the time, I wasn't familiar with GitHub, so I didn't post my work here.

Project Purpose
  
  -This post serves as a way for me to revisit my past work and reflect on my growth as a developer.
  
Game Features

  -The game includes a predetermined list of scenarios that occur randomly as you explore the dungeon. Depending on your responses to the prompts, different outcomes unfold.
  -Originally, the game was designed to end when your character dies. However, to save time, I modified it to end after five scenarios max to avoid repetitive gameplay for my professor. Since the scenarios are random, sometimes you would encounter the same one repeatedly. Additionally, some scenarios healed your character, prolonging the game.

Future Updates

  -If I were to update this game now, I would add a definitive ending, such as reaching the end of the dungeon and receiving a special reward.
  -Initially, I wanted to store items the character received in an external file but couldn't get it to work before the deadline. I would use a stack or linked list to manage and display the items.

Reflection

  -In the folder, there is another README file that provides an in-depth explanation of the project.
  -Keep in mind that this project was made about five years ago. While it's somewhat cringe-worthy to look back, it's also exciting to see my development progress.
  -I was pleasantly surprised by the different ways I implemented features in this game. It also reminded me of the challenges of working with C++. ðŸ˜„
