# RPG-Dungeon-Crawler-Game
This is a text-based dungeon crawler game I created for my C++ class in college. At the time, I wasn't familiar with GitHub, so I didn't post my work there.

This post serves as a way for me to revisit my past work and see how much I've grown. 

The game features a predetermined list of scenarios that occur randomly as you explore the dungeon. Depending on your responses to the prompts, different outcomes unfold.

The game originally was supposed to end when your character dies. However for the sake of time I actually had made it so that it ended at 5 scenarios max so that my professor didnt have to go through the same scenario constantly until they died. Since its random, sometimes you would get the same scenario over and over again. There are also scenarios where your character is healed so it prolonged the game. 

If I were to update this game now, I would add a definitive ending, such as reaching the end of the dungeon and receiving a special reward. I initially wanted to store items the character received in an external file but couldn't get it to work before the deadline. I think I would use a stack or linked list to manage and display the items.

In the folder there is anothe readme file that goes in depth about the project. 

Keep in mind that this was made about five years ago. A lot has changed since then. While it's somewhat cringe-worthy to look back, it's also cool to see how much I've grown as a developer.

I was pleasantly surprised to see the different ways I implemented things in this game. It also reminded me of the challenges of working with C++. ðŸ˜„
